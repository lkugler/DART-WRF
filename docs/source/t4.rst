Output files
###############

**Goal**: Give an overview of the output files and folders created by DART-WRF.

Forecast files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Forecast history files are stored per init time in ``/<experiment>/YYMMDD_HHMM/<ens>/wrfout_d0*``, 
as set in the parameter ``dir_archive`` of :class:`dartwrf.utils.Config`.
The file format is NetCDF.


Assimilation files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Diagnostics (obs_seq files) are stored in ``/<experiment>/diagnostics/``, as defined in
the parameters ``pattern_obs_seq_out`` and ``pattern_obs_seq_final`` of :class:`dartwrf.utils.Config`.
Files are typically named ``%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M_obs_seq.final``.
The file is readable in a text editor. 
To open it in Python as a pandas DataFrame, use :class:`dartwrf.obs.obsseq` or `pyDARTdiags <https://ncar.github.io/pyDARTdiags/>`_.

Analysis files in NetCDF format are stored per assimilation time in ``/<experiment>/YYMMDD_HHMM/``, e.g.
``output_mean.nc`` or ``filter_restart_d01.0001`` (one file per ensemble member). 
Which files are output by DART is set in the DART namelist, settable through the ``dart_nml`` parameter, 
see `DART docs <https://docs.dart.ucar.edu/en/latest/guide/controlling-files-output.html>`_.
