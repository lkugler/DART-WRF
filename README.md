# DART-WRF

This is a python package which allows you to
- run the Weather Research and Forecast model [WRF](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/docs/docs_and_pubs.html),
- generate (satellite) observations from a nature run,
- and assimilate these observations in ensemble data assimilation using [DART](https://docs.dart.ucar.edu/en/latest/),
- on a computing cluster or on your local machine.

DART-WRF is mainly hosted at the University of Vienna's GitLab, [gitlab.phaidra.org](https://gitlab.phaidra.org/dataassimilation/DART-WRF/). 
Documentation and tutorials are available at [readthedocs.io](https://dart-wrf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
