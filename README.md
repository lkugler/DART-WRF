# DART-WRF

this an 'interface' to use the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model.

The code currently is ~99.9% from the [DART-WRF Tutorial](http://www.image.ucar.edu/wrfdart/tutorial/) but contains no data files.
DART itself is available at github: @NCAR/DART
